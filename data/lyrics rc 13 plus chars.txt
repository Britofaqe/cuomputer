i lost and you won
i love you so much
i need to know now
i saw a sweet baby
i told you i would
i want to crawl in
i want to help you
i want to hold you
i want you to know
i was born to give
i was made for you
i will love you so
i will never leave
i will protect you
i won’t be messing
i'll take my board
i'm a block of ice
i'm disintegratin'
i'm spread so thin
if you get with me
into another place
it laughed so hard
it's gonna hurt me
it’s another night
it’s only the weak
i’ll bleed you now
i’m a special kind
i’m a troublemaker
i’m a useless tool
i’m afraid to look
i’m begging domino
i’m gonna bury you
i’m losin’ my mind
i’m seeing red now
i’m smellin’ funny
i’m so embarrassed
i’ve got leave you
know what is right
leaving you behind
let the music play
living without you
look the other way
looking for action
lying on the floor
metro screaming by
never been a faker
no matter how ugly
no more hesitating
no one talks to me
not a double taker
not me and not you
ogle living things
our hearts are dim
our minds are free
put them guns away
red roses blooming
s were copying you
scare me real good
scrape every quark
she is in my tears
she is your marrow
she's all i've got
she's got a tattoo
slash and axl rose
sniffin’ that glue
so baby let’s roll
so gimme some love
so i learn to turn
so try and be cool
some of them crazy
starin' back at me
still i understand
stop it if you can
take away the hurt
take back the love
tell me if you can
tell me what to do
that is all i know
that out somewhere
that you feel that
the christmas song
then kiss her toes
then mind your biz
there was kiki dee
they are wondering
they called me pig
they don’t mean it
they gave me a hat
this is not for me
though i loved you
thrown it all away
un cry these tears
watch me back flip
we fail each other
we watched titanic
we're goin' surfin
we're just vistors
we've got the time
we’ll be just fine
what i did do them
what you doing now
when do i lay down
worlds come and go
wrestle with jimmy
you can pack it up
you can see things
you can’t break me
you can’t have fun
you dug me so much
you got the brains
you had a good run
you have authority
you know i'm yours
you know what else
you must chill out
you should show it
you walk up to her
your eyes are slit
you’re sui generis
…too late too late
a couple love birds
a knock on the door
act like you own it
ain’t got much time
all these breathers
always take me back
anything you desire
anytime you want me
back at wilson high
back in wilson high
becoming dust   kim
boy you are the one
can anybody hear me
can’t stop partying
clear out of my biz
come on and kick me
come on and kiss me
come sit next to me
crab if you need it
deeper than the sea
didn’t pay the rent
don't you ever fear
don’t read no books
don’t you be a slob
eating at the heart
faces are wondering
fake another moment
flowers in her hair
get yourself a wife
happy to be singing
happy we’re excited
haunt you every day
here comes the beat
how can i reach out
how we gonna fix it
i became a big shot
i can’t help myself
i could be arrested
i don't belong here
i don't want to die
i go out of my mind
i gotta get me some
i just don’t belong
i just pass through
i know i'm a sinner
i love working hard
i marginalized them
i never meant to do
i never noticed you
i see her every day
i see him every day
i see you come here
i try to do my best
i wanna feel it too
i want to touch you
i was born to shine
i will make you see
i'm a puppet's fool
if you wanna get by
if you watch her go
is a favorite treat
it could be so good
it had a baby on it
it hurts me so much
it just ain’t right
it's a cryin' shame
it's all your fault
it’s coming someday
it’s pissin’ me off
it’s the beach boys
i’ll be next to you
i’ll keep you young
i’ll make it happen
i’m gonna’ be there
i’m gunnin’ for you
i’ve got to get off
jump from the stage
just like i’m solar
knock down drag out
lay with me tonight
lay your money down
let it all hang out
let me hear you say
let’s get up and go
little do they know
look at the winners
look at what we got
lookin’ for romance
made my teacher mad
marryin’ a beeyotch
meet me in the dark
my girls are mutual
my head's well read
my life is changing
my support has left
my voice is ringing
nothing much to see
once could kiss you
one below the waist
pardon me my friend
pick up your action
reach out our hands
ready for any fight
she kept on dancing
she run run run run
she was proud of us
she's in your bones
show your true self
silently holding on
slogging in my room
so who gives a damn
some of them stupid
stay with me awhile
sunshine is falling
superfriend reprise
take me all the way
take me by the hand
tell me if you know
that i’ve found you
that's for all time
that’s human nature
the  christmas song
the california kids
the goal slips away
then why lead me on
then you dropped my
these are the songs
they make me so mad
they only sicken me
think that is swell
this if how we feel
this is nothing new
this is such a pity
this is what i like
to console my tears
turn it all the way
waiting and waiting
waste our time away
we are all on drugs
we go together baby
we raised some hell
we went on a bender
we're goin' surfin'
what's a matter you
what’s your problem
when i lose my cool
when i'm not around
with so many pieces
you can have anyone
you can't avoid her
you can’t feel love
you could forget it
you just stand tall
you need a guardian
you were just a toy
you would do it too
you're my only love
your dad was silent
you’re gone to stay
'cuz feeling is pain
act like a grown man
all of these suckers
all your old friends
alone in a dark room
are you feelin' blue
as i bike home alone
as long as i approve
carolers are singing
cause that’s the way
coming out all wrong
don’t be afraid girl
don’t listen to them
down on santa monica
dragon colored tears
everybody let’s rock
everytime i pin down
flaunt your features
fly away in the wind
get what you deserve
gonna hit the ground
gonna rock and dance
gonna take my chance
got to get it louder
happy that i’m alone
hardly a soul around
havin’ seven keeyods
her blood’s my blood
how i love that song
i ain’t never comin’
i can still remember
i can't confront you
i can't help it girl
i can’t be held down
i can’t blow him off
i can’t see straight
i don’t care no more
i don’t feel the joy
i feel it in my feet
i got to be with you
i gotta be a big boy
i gotta live my life
i just want to shout
i know it is what it
i know what is right
i know you feel safe
i look at my friends
i never lose my mind
i picked up a guitar
i used to have a bed
i wanna have control
i want to soothe you
i want you to notice
i wish i was special
i wish you were home
i won't let you down
i'm bitter and alone
i'm down on my knees
i'm just thawing out
i've got ace frehley
i've got kitty pryde
i've got peter criss
if there comes a day
if you don’t like it
in a beautiful world
in between molecules
in the simple things
is this in your plan
it holds me together
it used to be a game
it's all been erased
it's time i got back
it’s beautiful to me
it’s got to come out
it’s hard to be real
it’s hard to be true
i’ll think about you
i’m a remarkable guy
i’m alone in my room
i’m in love with her
i’m letting you know
i’m living all alone
i’m so afraid of you
i’ve been so patient
la la la la la la la
lead me to the prize
leave my best behind
let me see the smile
let the mohawks grow
let the rockers roll
mash you in the nads
may the best man win
maybe i need fantasy
maybe it’ll work out
my cardigan disaster
my girl don't see me
my hairdo isn’t cool
my hands are smoking
my life is beautiful
my room is empty now
never disrespect you
never getting enough
no matter who’s i am
no one seems to care
nobody else has time
nothing i could hold
nothing to stop them
open your arms honey
out with my brothers
overjoyed as any boy
put me back together
refused my romancin’
running ableton live
say that you love me
she got sick one day
she had withered all
she was just pretend
she was my cutie pie
she'll await for you
slap you on the face
so baby take it easy
so i look at my life
so people all around
so we kissed goodbye
sorry we just missed
sped away 2000 miles
still i sit and wait
still you want to go
suddenly we’re apart
teenage victory song
that man is so obese
the games you played
they’ve been wanting
though i trusted you
thought i needed you
to make it up to you
took my friends away
turning up the radio
waiting for me there
waiting there for me
want for her to stay
want for him to stay
watch the stars play
we fall to the floor
we need pat on drums
we play another show
we see what it means
we swore it was over
we were born to rock
what's a matter babe
what's wrong with me
when i need a thrill
when i turn you away
when i woke up today
when it’s party time
when time marches on
when you’re on drugs
who’s faxing you now
with alligator shoes
with my mama's mason
women were screaming
working at papa jo’s
wouldn't you know it
wreck upon the shore
you are not learning
you can be like them
you can't resist her
you to i want you to
you turn californian
you were made for me
you're a tragic girl
you're as real as me
your family's normal
your light is fading
'cos i'm feeling fine
afraid to take a trip
all around the nation
as i take this action
boy i need to release
bust rhymes real slow
can i buy you a drink
can we bleed together
cause you’re on drugs
cheese smells so good
christmas celebration
city streets at night
climbing up the tower
come right back to me
cut me some slack off
death and destruction
do you wanna get high
don't drink the water
dreams are on my mind
even though i have to
except for the losers
falling off the track
flexing all our clout
get something through
got myself kicked out
guys were copying you
hard times come to me
he's got me wondering
he’s rolling you over
hiding in the shadows
i ain’t got all night
i can take on anybody
i can't talk about it
i can’t see straight…
i can’t stop partying
i don't know who i am
i don’t feel the pain
i feel a deeper peace
i gotta reach the top
i hope you believe me
i know it isn’t right
i made up with my dad
i never cry like that
i used to have a home
i wanna see the world
i wanna see you again
i want a perfect body
i want a perfect soul
i want you to be mine
i will give it to you
i'll stand beside her
i'm a good little boy
i'm fallin' to pieces
i'm riding on the bus
i'm waiting patiently
if i am feeling wacky
in a mighty long time
in detroit metal city
in front of the house
in my parents’ tercel
it ain't no real hoot
it didn’t make us sad
it makes me feel good
it's true you like me
it’s gonna be alright
it’s harder on my own
i’ll be your weakness
i’m flying up so high
i’m gonna be your man
i’m gonna work it out
i’m not gonna give up
i’m ready to love you
i’ve got my hash pipe
just like wild clover
kick you out of sight
let me know the truth
let’s get it together
m1’s started scanning
maybe i can live with
maybe they’ll tell me
my night just started
next to the shoe town
no one could touch me
normal came to an end
nothing tourist shops
on the sun in the sky
one night in december
rc seems to stand out
registers ka chinging
say it's not too late
say that you love me…
shattered by an email
she was my girlfriend
shivering in the cold
smell you on my hands
so i apologize to you
so it all makes sense
so put them guns away
so we’ll burn in hell
someone i could greet
something is bubbling
spinning in the crowd
standing in the light
still i have to fight
stuck in rigor mortis
surrender to her love
sweet girl i need you
take you home with me
tell me what to do x3
tell me what you want
that’s just how it is
the angel and the one
the hat was awful rad
the jewel of the nile
the world is watching
then i wake up crying
there's a truck ahead
these nucleotides are
they do have the slab
they never feel wrong
they was happy for me
things get so elusive
this ain’t believable
this ain’t impossible
this ain’t improbable
till i’ve had my fill
time for a swift kick
turn off the dsl line
up to the stars we go
wake the next morning
walked out of my life
we can bring together
we give our best away
we look good together
we would always agree
we’re finally landing
what is wrong with me
when you start crying
where they play tunes
who do i got to blame
who needs to be jaded
who put on your heart
who you callin’ bitch
who's that funky dude
why don't you stop it
why don’t you tell me
why won't you tell me
with no cheering crew
you always trusted me
you can use this fool
you got to believe me
you got to get off it
you got your problems
you know what you got
you made a whole army
you never forgot them
you want poached eggs
your beauty has faded
you’re a broken shell
you’re laughing at me
you’re living a dream
you’re my best friend
70 input go to the end
a boy and his computer
a friend who boinks me
a love that never ends
all the broken tethers
all the ecstasy       
all the flying daggers
all the times you came
amy moore blew her top
any more than you or i
anything that you want
apart from your stitch
as i was bustin' loose
as we cramp on the pot
ashamed of what i said
back to the shack in a
back to where i belong
billy jean and she bop
can’t knock the hustle
cause you’re so scared
chilllin’ in the shack
chopping up wave files
chorus say it ain't so
christmas stupefaction
conducts the orchestra
disappear in the night
do it to me every time
do you mind if i smoke
don’t be talking silly
down deep inside i cry
dreaming about my wife
drink a quart of vodka
each of us is a player
eulogy for a rock band
fed me ice cream cones
frightened of the dark
getting up and leaving
gonna scream and shout
haven’t slept for five
he truly saved my life
hesitate to throw your
how can i prove to you
i ain't no mister cool
i can't change my ways
i can't wash away your
i cried so many nights
i don't wanna be alone
i don’t have a purpose
i don’t stand a chance
i don’t wanna lose you
i don’t want your love
i ended up with nobody
i got a friend tonight
i had two best friends
i have no hope anymore
i have to let you know
i just want to ooh ahh
i never could with one
i really want a chance
i really want a friend
i said you never cared
i said you never tried
i should have ran away
i started feeling dumb
i still put up a fight
i swear it's it's true
i told him to back off
i told you once before
i took you to best buy
i walked up to ask her
i wanna get in you now
i want sugar in my tea
i was makin good bread
i will never leave you
i'll never do you harm
i'm carrying the wheel
i'm just a regular guy
i'm left alone at home
i'm not a stalker perv
i'm so glad i am yours
i'm the preacher's son
if i can’t get a trick
if we die in obscurity
if you’re up all night
in a perfect situation
it's in the photograph
it’s coming up someday
it’s kind of wonderful
it’s such a nice scene
i’ll be like a brother
i’ll be standing there
i’ll go out of my mind
i’m all alone at night
i’m gonna’ be your man
i’m not just after sex
i’m not used to losing
i’m ready to trust you
i’m too tired to fight
i’ve been watching you
i’ve heard that before
keep doing what you do
lets make em feel dumb
long ago i didn’t know
looking for road kills
my bunk is really dark
my girl's got eyeballs
my love is a lifetaker
no more sighing in her
no one can save me now
only trust can inspire
pour yourself some tea
raise your candle high
red lights are moaning
running around w masks
satisfied in every way
scored a hundred count
see what you are going
set a new world record
she cared for my bones
she didn’t have a soul
she was my true friend
she's got me wondering
sing along in choruses
so in love and emotion
some of my friends did
sometimes i let you go
tell her it's over now
that is your womanhood
the cash deposit of $5
the odd couple is what
the pain is killing me
the ringing in my ears
then i'll be your tool
there's just one thing
they can keep you here
they don’t give a shit
think we got a problem
thinking with my willy
this ain’t predictable
till the morning light
till you hit the ocean
to fly where they will
waited she didn't care
wasting time on my own
we cause so much agony
we were willing to pay
we've all left the den
we've drained the well
we’re eating ice cream
what does this signify
what i think i want to
what you've done to me
whatc wanna do tonight
when honesty kills you
when will stupid learn
whip out my binoculars
who needs stupid books
why i can’t please you
will i believe the sun
will only last one day
with a brand new sound
with a kiss in the air
you can’t hold me back
you don’t need to fear
you got to get with it
you lead a tragic life
you show me no respect
you're so very special
your lover in the snow
your skin makes me cry
your tongue is twisted
you’re such a pushover
'cause i'm feeling fine
180 proof vitamin water
a heart to tender heart
ain't no butterfly girl
all i could think about
as bears come to get me
back together after all
before the sacred basin
burnin' inside my brain
cause i speak sincerely
cause it’s gonna be fun
chilling back in boston
christmas to perfection
cobwebs on your eyelids
come on come on come on
deep down i know you're
drenched in blood songs
every hour of every day
everybody get dangerous
far away let's go today
fortune favors the bold
from the back of my car
get your stuff together
go ahead and move along
hand it to the tourists
i bet he lives close by
i can hear the chitchat
i cant help my feelings
i can’t feel your touch
i can’t help my boogies
i charmed the lifeguard
i could never let it be
i could never let it go
i don't care 'bout that
i don't do that so well
i don’t know what to do
i don’t see this ending
i don’t wanna’ lose you
i don’t want your lovin
i know it is what it is
i know that you’re fine
i know what to call you
i know you’re out there
i like you way too much
i might get my ass beat
i must be made of steel
i need to be understood
i never seen you before
i never swear like that
i really start to freak
i really wanna take you
i used to feel allright
i want to hear it again
i will never let you go
i will set at your feet
i'm so glad you're mine
i'm tired of having sex
i've got a 12 sided die
i've never been so sure
if it's too late to try
in the back of her head
in the night i was born
it may have been a game
it's been a year or two
it's hot when i’m alone
its getting hot in here
it’s not like yesterday
it’s time we move it on
i’d be lost without her
i’d like to get to know
i’ll make it all happen
i’m at a loss for words
i’m filled with remorse
i’m growing out my hair
i’m not like the others
i’ve got to have patrón
i’ve learned my lessons
i’ve never been so sure
i’ve thrown it all away
know one thing i’m king
knowing that the one he
la la la you sang to me
let the good times roll
let's try to be friends
let’s turn up the radio
lived a new summer morn
living in beverly hills
long ago you said to me
making love at the eddy
maybe we’re all through
monday night i'm makin'
monjiga dweo naragayaji
move them close to mics
my mom drives a big rig
my world is underground
never again will i reap
on an island in the sun
only hope will remember
our bones start to ache
our life will be broken
pleased to meet you but
put on your old pajamas
rivers has lost his way
seven months of suicide
she put her knickers on
she tore it off my head
she was too fast for me
simple pages on my mind
sleep tight in your cot
so 'scuse me if i drool
so afraid of letting go
so i call you anonymous
so i gotta have my rock
so i’m blowin’ my stack
so she starts to wander
someday i know that you
someone who would smile
sometimes i hurt you so
sweetheart of sigma chi
swimming in the mystery
tain’t gonna do no good
take me back to my home
take me really far away
ten girls under my shoe
ten years down the road
that made you forget me
the audience is waiting
the driver said hey man
the first shall be last
the girls singing gimme
the love you gave to me
the sweetest of all sin
the things i wished for
they get out of control
things were better then
this bottle of steven's
til the school bus came
to save herself for you
toilet paper the fences
turtledoves are calling
unless they're laughing
waiting by for me there
wakin’ up the neighbors
we ain’t gonna break up
we got a long way to go
we had our flight plans
we'll run away together
we’ll run away together
what am i doing up here
what do we make of this
what you doing now girl
when all they do is say
when were you intending
when you’re on your own
where does he come from
where eagle court bends
why do they gotta front
why won’t you surrender
will we ever find peace
with our face in a knot
without an old man cane
wouldn't leave me alone
you are my baby tonight
you are such a blessing
you came out of nowhere
you got your big cheese
you know that it’s true
you put 'em all on hold
you really freak me out
you see i own this town
you told me it was true
you took me to best buy
you're mary tyler moore
you're tearin' it apart
your hands keep turning
you’ve got your big g's
a love that never starts
a place to call your own
all i can do is say that
all my hurting goes away
already i’m anticipating
as i go down …the drain…
as long as i’m breathing
awakens ancient feelings
baby you're a lot of fun
castle built in the sand
cause i was made for you
cause i’m freaking bored
come on and kick me woah
come on and kiss me woah
come to my sick bed baby
counting all the flowers
don’t hang out in my den
don’t you worry about me
drinkin’ that cheap beer
every word that you know
fallen lemons in my path
get them close to mics –
girl we got a good thing
got nothin’ in my pocket
her love is like the sea
he’d do anything for you
hungry nights once again
i ain’t ever comin’ back
i am always on a mission
i be trippin’ on my feet
i bet he's just a friend
i can learn self control
i can't be more of a man
i can't control my brain
i can’t control my brain
i can’t help my feelings
i can’t love my business
i can’t rewrite the book
i could never get enough
i count my steps i’m ocd
i don't care if it hurts
i don't want to be alone
i don’t care what you do
i don’t wanna let you go
i don’t want your lovin’
i feel the pain you feel
i got to admit the truth
i gotta get my groove on
i hear the phone singing
i just can’t get no play
i play my stupid songs i
i remember playing there
i should have no feeling
i thought i had a friend
i too am waiting for you
i took some for the team
i wait at home patiently
i want to be there again
i want to give it to you
i'd rather eat some mace
i'm lost just like a cow
i'm no six foot hot look
i'm watchin' and waitin'
i've never been so happy
if you'd come back to me
inhale through your nose
it makes me feel so fine
it makes me feel so good
it might have hurt a lot
it sounds like fun to me
it's bad for your health
it's hot i had no choice
it’s hard to fall asleep
i’d rather eat some mace
i’ll be down on my knees
i’ll make you love me 3x
i’ll make you understand
i’m gonna beat you right
i’m gonna play all night
i’m not in love with you
i’m not the toughest guy
i’m reaching out my hand
i’m runnin’ out of fight
i’m still in my bathrobe
i’m tearin’ up this town
i’ve got the magic in me
i’ve gotta have the cars
i’ve never been so happy
knowing i don’t love her
let me hear you shout it
let me tell you 'bout it
let me wash at your sink
lived a new summer morn’
making my eyes get moist
mama you ain't gonna die
maria i’m red with shame
my best friends are gone
my whole scene has split
no one will live forever
no there is no other one
nobody knows her like me
nobody knows me like her
on a burnt piece of lamb
on my way in such a fuss
on the road with kerouac
promised you'd always be
rasta don’t work for cia
rockin’ out like it’s 94
rollin’ like a celebrity
say goodbye to every day
say you'll love me again
scattered on the surface
she won’t be coming down
sheltered in his bivouac
so come on while you can
so in love with yourself
so stand up for yourself
sometimes i want a taste
sorry about my past life
sorry i forgot your name
strollin down the avenue
take a listen around you
take us to your daughter
that fall for your spell
the air is cold and damp
the chance is in my hand
the damage in your heart
the knee stocking flavor
the nights are so unkind
the sun is shining on me
these are my heart songs
things are all brand new
to sit and think all day
turn to something better
turtle doves are calling
waste the precious hours
wayne you know it’s true
we look good together x2
we will write a postcard
were meant to lead me on
we’re stuck in space now
what the hell am i doing
what's with these homies
whatever makes you happy
what’s so damn important
when i acted like a fool
when the robin makes his
when we die we rearrange
when you're on a holiday
when you’re on a holiday
where's the goddamn exit
who have you been seeing
why don't you understand
why don’t you understand
with all the temptations
with my mama's mason jar
with the taste of a teat
write these stupid words
yesterday i went outside
you already shot me down
you always were a friend
you best not come around
you can’t fly this thing
you don't need no memory
you don’t need no memory
you float like a feather
you give him your loving
you know i love you true
you make me wish i was a
you walk along that face
you walk along that line
you're all that i wanted
your iq is 20 points low
your kissing and hugging
your mom cooked meatloaf
your witches are sinkin’
you’d a thought i had it
you’re the air i breathe
you’re wanting some love
you’ve got your problems
a friend to tender friend
ain't gonna cause a scene
all my relationships fake
all of the drugs she does
all that i've done to you
and then my heart stopped
as we drift into the zone
back to where i came from
burning flame in december
can’t knock the hustle x2
caught a lovely butterfly
confrontations in my mind
deleted i can’t blame you
do that which you must do
don’t be afraid to holler
everybody clap your hands
everybody needs salvation
everything you gave to me
from the girls all around
gonna let it all hang out
got caught in your throat
hi def details in my eyes
how am i supposed to sing
how did things get so bad
how long i’ve waited here
i admit this is a problem
i ain't gonna hurt nobody
i ain't never coming back
i already know the answer
i am done with perfection
i count her steps i’m ocd
i don’t really wanna stay
i don’t want to be lonely
i fall and hit the ground
i forgot that disco sucks
i got a heart that bleeds
i gotta keep my eyes open
i had to wear a paperface
i hear pain in your voice
i know how to pick on you
i know i’ll figure it out
i know that you need help
i know that you'd hear me
i let love down the drain
i need to find some peace
i read the program by the
i said listen to the heat
i told you i would return
i will always be that way
i won’t pick up the phone
i'm shakin' at your touch
if you could come near me
in my ani difranco screed
in the garage i feel safe
is the loneliest of times
it ain’t too far from now
it started with a whisper
it’s getting unbelievable
i’d party with my friends
i’ll be here in your arms
i’m a mess since you left
i’m goin’ out with homies
i’m here right beside you
i’m running out of energy
i’m so sorry miss sweeney
i’ve gone and lost my way
i’ve got to clear the air
i’ve got to have the beat
i’ve got to have the cars
keep on doing what you do
keep your fingers crossed
leading on that poor girl
let's go away for a while
lets set our hair on fire
let’s get out of the city
life of chasing butterfly
longtime sunshine upon me
looked in on my fairy pet
love grows at light speed
my girl's got a big mouth
my heart is still beating
my shining star will rise
not a single damn thing  
not wanting to upset guys
our hate will be unspoken
pat gives scott a 4 count
pat should play the drums
percussion in on choruses
playing on the tambourine
put a brand new record on
really special might come
remind me who i am inside
riffx2 try something else
she had withered all away
she washed my dirty hands
show me how to live right
sing your love come to me
so they can get paid back
sometimes i feel very sad
sometimes i lose my pride
sometimes i push too hard
stumbling around the town
suddenly our shortcomings
taxi drivers selling weed
tell me what i’ve done x2
than a cad or a scoundrel
that i needed you so much
that made them so violent
that which might hurt you
that you float in the air
that you’ve torn me apart
that's where i want to be
that’s where i want to be
the angels in the heavens
the presents are in place
the purification of water
then you would surely see
they all just let me down
they are for petty crooks
they lived down the block
they’ll try to understand
think of how destroyed he
this is beginning to hurt
this is how my father was
till i’m reachin’ the top
to be solved other day 2x
to kill you in your sleep
to our friends and family
to save you from yourself
today i picked them fresh
tried to thicken the plot
trippin’ down the freeway
turning further every day
underneath your paperface
undo this hurt you caused
walking to his grave plot
walking with the mexicans
wanda you’re my only love
we balance each other out
we'll meet you in hermosa
welcome to happiness lane
west coast does it better
what do you want me to do
when everybody talks back
when i look in the mirror
when you were here before
where i'm from so fragile
where tricks are for kids
whether it's funny or not
who is it here that i see
whoa lord i’m coming home
why do we hurt each other
why haven't you called me
will throw you a lifeline
with this thing in my way
without your love i'd die
you can pack this mornin’
you charmed the lifeguard
you know that i trust you
you laugh and play around
you push me over the edge
you say it's a good thing
you take your car to work
you think i’ll never know
you won’t be mine anymore
you're just like an angel
you're nineteen days late
you've got the beach boys
you've seen it all before
your heart's made of wood
your words will fade away
you’re all that i can see
you’ve seen it all before
10 input what is your name
all alone on the promenade
all that i can do is grope
all that you ask him to do
ause they’d like my behind
bgv in second half of solo
boys to sing beverly hills
building bridges not walls
cause i was destined to be
coming out all wrong songs
couldn’t let them rot away
cry and cry and let it out
don’t let me play football
down on santa monica where
down the circle of friends
even as i anoint your door
even for just a day or two
every time you turn around
everybody has a good laugh
from the wood in the floor
gathering the sordid clues
gets caught in your throat
give me some of that stuff
home is where the heart is
how did we survive so well
hwiparam soriro dora oneyo
i belong in the rock world
i can't believe what i see
i can't have any other one
i commend your stubborness
i don’t care where you are
i don’t know what i can do
i don’t want to be a chump
i got to play in this game
i ingest my two fried eggs
i just want to live a long
i know that you don’t care
i know we’ll figure it out
i know what you’re feelin’
i know where we need to go
i must be all these things
i never heard of paperface
i still hear your laughter
i thought this was reality
i wanna feel it every hour
i will be here until i die
i will send my best to you
i wonder how we came to be
i won’t listen to messages
i work my skin to the bone
i'll always be your friend
i'm getting up and leaving
if i'm a dog then you're a
influencing your next move
it all makes so much sense
it feels good to be a jerk
it's the cream of the crop
it’s an incredible high x4
it’s the days of our lives
it’s what i was born to do
i’ll keep holding on today
i’m getting up and leaving
i’m going to pay the price
i’m lost without your love
i’m moving out to cherokee
i’m ready to give my heart
i’m still afraid of it all
i’m the baddest of the bad
i’ve gotta have the jewels
i’ve seen this game before
just jeer the same ol crap
life means nothing anymore
looking back into our past
make mistakes without them
makes me feel so in secure
maybe i can live with that
me i never had much breaks
mixing up oj and champagne
my blue jeans need a patch
my girl we’ll say good bye
my heart is so land locked
need some time to remember
never going to give you up
no one cares about my ways
right here on the sidewalk
right now everything sucks
see now how happy they are
she cared for my happiness
she would never go with me
she's got her own concerns
she's running out the door
should i call an ambulance
so in love it makes me sad
so stoked to mellow it out
so with my mom i now agree
some dude just grabbed her
sorry if i caused you harm
sorry if i caused you pain
stars can’t talk they have
take me to your love shack
that our world's gone dark
that was when i kissed her
that’s when i fell in love
the asceticism of jonas vs
the bees are flying around
the moon is just half full
the radio's the only light
the workers are goin' home
the world is still turning
then she made my lips hurt
there is no way i can stop
there’s no cause for these
there’s nothing you can do
they throw that shit at us
they're still makin' noise
those things to me and i’m
though my heart will break
times you can try too hard
to watch my brother’s back
waiting for 'misses right'
was it me or san francisco
we can listen to bacharach
we don't understand anyway
we don’t care what you say
we got all the right moves
we’ll see a chain reaction
we’re turning up the radio
what ya’ playin’ in my ear
what’s the world coming to
when criminals are victims
when i come home from work
when she's with my friends
when you say what you hate
when you’re trying to find
which way is the graveyard
who could beat up your man
who’s down for a good time
will lead you to your room
will show you the sunshine
won't you give me a minute
you came back this mornin’
you can come along with me
you can watch me back flip
you can’t put that on sale
you don’t even hear it now
you don’t know what to say
you got your problems woah
you know you drive me wild
you said you never need me
you took some for the team
you wanted arts and crafts
your firm's got the stones
you’re hittin’ the ceilin’
all of the love that i need
all of these games you play
all the others will join us
all these ladies on the net
anticipating your next move
barame nalryogan nae noredo
big sing a long in choruses
cause i don’t want to break
come back to me as whistles
cooler than the ice capades
deep inside all these years
diane what good would it do
doesn’t hurt so bad anymore
don't just assume it's okay
don’t eat no dinner tonight
don’t you let my heart down
even though they told me so
everything a boy could need
feeling fancies every night
forgive your foolish father
get your hands off the girl
give me a last chance honey
here is a paint brush so go
how comical this stuff that
i can’t get back home alone
i can’t see you every night
i can’t turn back the clock
i deal out my business if i
i didn’t mean to get so mad
i don’t even know your name
i feel the chill in the air
i know i’ve just been lying
i know that you’re in there
i know what you’re thinkin’
i looked you up on ancestry
i may not be a perfect soul
i need cash to pay my bills
i never thought i’d do that
i never thought that anyone
i smile at everything i see
i want you to i want you to
i was struggling to survive
i wonder how we came to be…
i won’t be with you tonight
i wrote a page it was awful
i'm begging for some action
i've got an electric guitar
if you care i’m wanting you
if you’re on a sinking ship
ignite the greatest fire th
in one of the people i meet
it's just sexual attraction
it's programmed in my genes
it's up to you set em free 
i’d like to be all over you
i’ll be on the satellite tv
i’ll never get tired of you
i’ll pose for the magazines
i’m begging for some action
i’m dreamin’ in the evening
i’m dreamin’ in the mornin’
i’m gonna be coming for you
i’m letting my feelings out
i’m not looking to harm you
i’m spiritual not religious
i’ve got to have the jewels
just jeer the same ol thing
let me hear you lay it down
liberty and justice for all
look up and follow the star
makes me feel kind of great
maybe then give him a treat
my clothes they don’t match
my favorite rock group kiss
my poor brain is gonna’ pop
never you mind what they do
no life from paloma to rose
no one put you in that ring
nobody can take her from me
nobody ever turned you down
only love can ease the pain
ooo when i’m hungry i sleep
opened up my heart and then
praise for the awakened one
prove to me that i am wrong
rich kids from the eastside
see a sweet in floral print
she looks around and around
sing your love to me softly
so i will be there with you
so please give up the fight
so with my mom i know agree
soggy lungs to breathe fire
sometimes it’s hard to know
take back the lovel scorcho
take my picture by the pool
thank you for being so kind
the bottle is ready to blow
the last shall be the first
the pagentry is such a bore
the sun it burns down on me
the sun won’t shine tonight
then keep on searching for 
then she put me in my place
there ain't no turning back
there is so much left to do
there was a brightening day
thermaflu was owned by bush
this is all the hope i have
til the day i couldn’t pass
to the place i could be gay
turn these pages of my mind
underneath you're a monster
we belong in the rock world
we can’t seem to move ahead
we've made a liar of desire
we’ll never forget the jams
we’ll split a cheese fondue
what are you doing up there
what the heck are you doing
when i dream to be allright
when i walk down the street
when i'm stable long enough
when nobody gave her a look
when we couldn't find sleep
when you're on a golden sea
when you’re on a golden sea
will decorate your grave   
will increase my will to be
will show you the starlight
wish me love a wishing well
wish my love a wishing well
wouldn't it be a cruel joke
you can talk for real to me
you fall and hit the ground
you know how the story goes
you left me out in the rain
you said you never loved me
you think i’m a fascist pig
your drug is a heartbreaker
your fine face i can’t take
you’re comin up worlds away
you’re home with the angels
a gorgeous four part harmony
a ticket cost only your mind
a way down deep inside i cry
after all his truth is small
all i know how to do is sing
all the little things you do
barame nalryogan nae noraedo
can’t even dance in the dark
cause you don’t look so cool
chageun gasumul modu modu eo
come and kiss this pain away
cos i'm running out of fight
couldn't look you in the eye
drag your name all over town
dreamin’ all through the day
even though i don’t eat meat
everybody thinks we’re crazy
everything reminds me of you
everytime that i turn around
get crowd to do i don't care
glorious children on my mind
glorious wastings of my time
go ahead and waste your life
gonna spend my days with you
gotta spend my days with you
hang on till i see you again
he’s taking advantage of you
hockey games on frozen ponds
i am terrified of all things
i can't run and i can't kick
i can't wash away your scent
i can’t win i’ve got to lose
i couldn’t put it in a novel
i didn't mean to do you harm
i don’t know if i can get by
i don’t know where i’m goin’
i got a lotta’ things to see
i gotta get me some now baby
i hate me and i hate you too
i have many memories of pain
i hope you don't object if i
i hope you don’t object if i
i know where this is heading
i met with the gal from expo
i put my jacket over my head
i reach my cubicle about 9 a
i really am in love with you
i see for miles and miles x4
i took a road trip to mexico
i wanna go to see your house
i wanna’ be just like a king
i want to go to the bathroom
i want to take you somewhere
i've got posters on the wall
if everyone's a little queer
if we die in obscurity   d e
if we sew our pants together
if you wanna start something
in my heart i feel it’s true
in your place an empty space
i’ll be out with my brothers
i’ll be your best of friends
i’ll fix up around the house
i’ll turn away from weakness
i’m goin’ out with my homies
i’m gonna tear down the wall
i’m heading home for the day
i’m the meanest in the place
just what am i s'posed to do
kumbaya makes me get violent
leading me to better prepare
let me just hold you closely
let me sleep in your bedroom
let's climb right in forever
let's sew our pants together
let’s sew our pants together
make it hard for me to think
mamas always gotta backtrack
married in my mind's no good
meet me in front of the pint
more and more i can’t say no
my lips are lined with drool
my purple majesty displaying
never sang the world my song
never thought it was a crime
never thought you’d graduate
no this ain’t no minute maid
on this road we'll never die
one who falls by the wayside
only faith can bring to life
riding my bike over the path
sad to say i pushed you away
she got hot and they did not
since i was out on the floor
singing out in a sweet voice
so i could find out who i am
so i’ll be up here in a rage
so much left for me to prove
so you laugh and play around
sorry i'm no good luck charm
sugar on the hard rock radio
take a load off and bow down
taxi drivers sell their weed
telling me to start freezing
that i'm just foolin' around
the pageantry is such a bore
the sun it burned down on me
then again that’s what we do
there's nothing to cry about
there’s no one else like you
there’s no one else to blame
these players come to get me
they wouldn’t laugh that way
they’ll all be singing along
they’re sayin’ of you and me
things are good or so i hear
this ain't no butterfly love
this business is really lame
till the day i couldn’t pass
to do what i think i want to
until my roommate said c’mon
use the lemons life gives me
we don't care about anything
we gonna let it all hang out
we hate to leave our shelter
we made it through the night
we take em out one at a time
we'll never feel bad anymore
we’ll never feel bad anymore
when we die we become a star
when you made your sacrifice
when you walked out the door
who's dialin' your car phone
why am i so obviously insane
without you my heart is blue
would you let me come inside
would you like some lemonade
you can bet i’ll pay the tab
you can’t control me no more
you were the song in my life
you’d be my partner in crime
you’re coming up worlds away
you’re just doing your thing
you’ve gone and turned on me
you’ve taken all that was me
15 years of ruling the planet
a pink triangle on her sleeve
all the strumming lyou'res   
all the wine we tasted       
all these problems on my mind
begging for that girl to stay
bodies be all up on my behind
bring back the joy to my life
come back and say you love me
didn’t care and couldn’t grow
do you miss the way we’d play
do you wanna get away with me
don't look now i lost my shoe
don’t blah blah blaaaaah blah
driving hard to make him lose
driving home on country roads
each with a new lease on life
get me another bottle of beer
gets caught up in your throat
give their light to you and i
guess i'll just close my eyes
hates him with a bitter      
have i lost my mind this time
hesitate to throw your stones
how can we make it back there
i can feel those metal chains
i can't take you back no more
i can’t believe that you said
i did what my body told me to
i don’t have the words to say
i don’t think we’ll ever give
i feel your touch every night
i gotta box full or your toys
i just want the summer to end
i just want to hit the ground
i know that we will always be
i know you don’t mean no harm
i know you like to live alone
i may snuff the burning flame
i might as well enjoy my life
i read books and you watch tv
i really really wanna go back
i thought i had found the one
i want to bask in the delight
i was closer to you back then
if you take this away from me
if you're wondering if i want
it hurts for me to see you so
it won't happen to me anymore
it's up to you to set em free
it’s the last day of the week
i’d give myself to please you
i’d like to thank farmer pete
i’ll become dust and fly away
i’ll take you there my friend
i’m a fix it if you mix it up
i’m gonna marry courtney love
i’m just a friend of a friend
i’m up in here in my own cell
i’m waiting until you love me
i’m your tiger burning bright
i’ve been spending time alone
i’ve been waiting for so long
keep cranking them beach boys
keep on searching for another
knowing that the one he loves
let’s get the fuck outta here
look at all those movie stars
lookin’ through my binoculars
more than you ever did before
my righteousness is crumbling
never you mind all the others
no more sighing in the breast
not all 19 year olds are cool
one thousand times in my head
put your arms around me child
radioac dioac dioac dioactive
remain and cover up the years
right now everything is black
same ol' dell latitude screen
she laughs at most everything
she said she’s feeling lonely
shooting from the stars above
show me where and i will sign
show some respect to the king
slayer taught me how to shred
so best be givin’ me your all
so much pain may come our way
somehow i’m keepin’ it steady
someone to tell us what to do
something they can barely see
sometimes i'm so disappointed
that i was not so trustworthy
that scar has never gone away
that’s what they’ll teach you
the knee stocking flavor is a
then i’m gonna play the field
there are things i have to do
there’s so much i want to say
they ain’t gonna keep me down
they’re pinning you to boards
things will never be the same
to a strange and distant land
to make it up to you some how
to the things we’ll never try
tonite i'm beggin' you please
until you’re blue you want it
up in space it’s always night
we could start a glorious day
we'll be together a long time
we'll spend some time forever
we're left with broken hearts
were i the last girl on earth
we’ll spend some time forever
we’ve reached the finish line
what the hell am i doin' here
what’s the deal with my brain
when the robin makes his nest
why don’t you come home to me
why don’t you tell me goodbye
with only just a year or 2 to
with which she blabbers a lot
won't you knock me on my head
you don’t know the way i feel
you may not be the one for me
your soothing midnight mantra
you’ll be my partner in crime
you’ll never be a better kind
you’re the best i’ve ever had
'cause everybody wants a dream
ain’t no matter how hard i try
all that you were fighting for
all the bull that people sling
ask with a smile on their face
asked for me to wait out there
can't she be a little straight
can’t be heard above the noise
casting my pearls before swine
cause i don’t want your lovin’
cause you’re wanting some love
chess is such a difficult game
come and take these tears away
deep in the heart of the earth
do some really funny things n’
do you believe what i sing now
don't bother to pack your bags
don't leave me out in the rain
don't seem to matter that much
dreamin’ all through the night
ease the pain that i must feel
eulogy for the rock stars in c
everyone blossoming in the sun
fare thee well where’er you go
forgotten memories bloom again
from the tree that i love best
gave me the coat off your back
getting late i just can't wait
girl when i’m in love with you
how’s this for arts and crafts
i can't believe how bad i suck
i can’t even look in your eyes
i didn’t know you had freckles
i got a real big posse with me
i got more than enough for you
i hear my song and it pulls me
i hope you don't object that i
i look in the eyes of my enemy
i wanna get close to your lips
i wanna’ live a life like that
i want to reach a higher plane
i was lost and so i shied away
i'm afraid i'm falling for you
if only they could see you now
ijeotdon giokdeuri pi o naneyo
is there someone there tonight
it's in the photograph of love
it’s just like a curse you see
it’s more like science fiction
it’s necessary to interrupt me
it’s time that we laid them in
it’s too late to turn back now
i’ll never miss another chance
i’m hopin’ that you would call
i’m so impressed by what i see
knew the day would surely come
locked up in your little world
my optic nerve is gonna freeze
my righteousness is crumbling’
no one hears a word i’m saying
no one hears me sing this song
not letting love play her hand
not this hate that destroys us
once i have got you in my hold
one more loss in a losing life
playing with your guns all day
see what you are going through
sex and drugs and rock n' roll
sitting alone on the promenade
smell you on my hands for days
so why am i still feeling blue
someday i’ll be coming for you
something they can barely know
sometimes i wanna get in a car
sometimes i'm so disillusioned
sometimes it don't seem so bad
take a look in between my eyes
taking pills and mellowing out
thanks for all you've shown us
that he can't get out the door
that he can’t get out the door
that i would suck without them
that’s all i really care about
the band was doin’ their thing
then i go to the store and beg
then won't we all be so clever
there must be a guardian angel
there used to be a better kind
there's more that i could take
there’s a boy who really hurts
there’s no one to blame myself
there’s no way that i can stop
there’s nothing that i can say
they get the spaces in between
they're fresh out of batteries
thinking bout the fight we had
this is what i was meant to do
this one is for you so come on
thought i knew you better then
thought i knew your intentions
to anyone else that i hurt too
today is better than yesterday
turns out i just pulled myself
until the day i threw you away
we got to take what we can get
we grow old our hearts are dim
when i met you i was all alone
when i see some guy talk smack
when i start to feel that pull
when i try to i never get far…
when i'd chill and settle down
who cares who’s wrong or right
why am i so hung up on you mom
why do all your favorites fall
without you i just can't go on
won't you stay with me tonight
won’t you stay with me tonight
you are fading further from me
you are taller than a mountain
you baked me brownies and said
you can’t feel any love inside
you got to take back your love
you know i've done that before
you light the skies of my life
you say i’m actin’ like a fool
you'll always be my girlfriend
all of your friends are through
all the things that come to you
angel girl in a cold dark world
are you guys in the secret club
as long as we get our own rooms
ba e son yore choj nen narimyon
cause i was made for loving you
cause i’m the next big thing in
crack it open let me outta here
don't leave me in all this pain
don’t call my baby on the phone
dreams will never happen to you
everybody get dangerous boo yah
everyone i know everyone i know
friday night i'm makin' sharise
get more from that which i have
get your head out of your hands
gimme some love gimme some love
give me something i can believe
goddamn you half japanese girls
gold high tops with no socks on
grungy girls and punk rock boys
hold this thread as i walk away
i almost killed every one of us
i am running through the meadow
i can't forget the day you left
i didn’t go to boarding schools
i don’t know if i can get right
i have always been a little shy
i heard your heart beating true
i just want to sing your gospel
i know i should get next to you
i know it’s too late to explain
i know there’s something better
i know you won't leave me alone
i may not be here when you call
i need someone here to guide me
i need your arms to hold me now
i never summon things from hell
i start to look around for love
i swear i will make you my wife
i tried taking a picture of you
i wonder how you touch yourself
i'm the epitome of public enemy
if it doesn’t come we make some
if there’s something i can grab
if you don’t move and get a job
is the sound of christmas cheer
it's automatic when you feel it
it's automatic when you know it
it's every man here for himself
it’s like we’re falling in love
it’s not enough to describe you
it’s sealed from the city sound
it’s something you’re born into
it’s time to take it back again
i’d like to get to know you too
i’ll keep you trying new things
i’m pissed off cuz no one cares
i’ve been scared to make a move
lets sell our eggs to any buyer
madness burnin' inside my brain
makin' sweet love all the night
michael jackson’s in the mirror
my mind begins the arrangements
no safety pads were ever put on
nobody else loves you like i do
nobody ever could make me smile
on top of that it’s a recession
preppy girls never looked at me
remember the white picket fence
screw rehab i love my addiction
she told me to follow the rules
sometimes i wanna build a house
spinning here inside this wheel
take the pinnch out of his butt
taking him in and letting me go
that i'd like to share with you
the pieces lie right before you
then even you’ll prepare a meal
there are goslings at the river
there’s a boy that really hurts
there’s gotta be more than this
these eyeballs are going to pop
they simply shine up in the sky
think of how destroyed he feels
thinking bout something you did
this is beginning to be serious
this puzzle can't be done wrong
though the air is cold and damp
thought i knew didn't have clue
time to sing out our happy song
to sing my teenage victory song
until i moved to the west coast
waited for so many lonely years
we don’t know where we’re goin’
we used to share one atmosphere
we'll be playing and having fun
we’ll be playing and having fun
we’ll crush this scene together
what i have is more than enough
where i found that to be smooth
where i was before you appeared
where the fuck you been all day
why are you so far away from me
why won't you tell me it's over
will i look back on the critics
with a woodstove or a fireplace
with you it feels like i forgot
you can't change people's minds
you can't find the words to say
you can’t find the words to say
you gave your love to me softly
you gonna love the risin’ above
you know this is breakin' me up
you moved the people to sobbing
you should turn your heart away
you spoke for the world in your
you wanna be free to relax more
you’ll feel okay in the morning
you’re running under the ground
you’re the heaven high up above
you’ve got a knife in your back
'cause everybody wants some hope
'cause everybody wants some love
all i have to do is think of you
all the girls get up when i sing
all the people that crowd around
can't i be makin' love come true
cause i ain’t afraid of the dark
cause i could not have it better
cause i’m the next big thing in…
come on come on come on i see it
deep in the shady glen i saw you
do the voodoo doll that gives me
don’t stress cuz we been blessed
drink champagne and smoke a bowl
even da vinci couldn’t paint you
fake smiles and nervous laughter
feeel things a little bit deeper
fifty years of ruling the planet
get on a bus and move to vermont
give me a chance to let you know
gonna make your dreams come true
got a 20 dollar tip on new years
happiness is such a fickle thing
he did the best that he could do
he is on a higher level than you
how is your heart little darling
i am complete is what i’m saying
i don’t even know where to start
i found out that everybody talks
i gather my small heart together
i got to laugh 'cause i know i'm
i have many fears about my greed
i just wanna stay just like this
i made a mistake without knowin’
i see the gang to which i belong
i thought i’d get a new audience
i wanna get in your hot tub baby
i won’t be a number on your list
i've been in suspended animation
i've known a lot of girls before
if only we open our eyes and see
in the middle of the living room
it doesn’t matter what they sing
it’s all that i can do right now
it’s only me and you from now on
i’m an iceberg with a warm heart
i’m going to haunt you every day
i’m in pain just like the spider
i’m sorry to my band members too
i’ve been walking for four years
jen tuesday night i'm makin' lyn
jerks are tryin' to ride my back
kick it on back to what you know
let’s see what you’ve got inside
making little angels in the sand
maybe we could even get together
mine is the loneliest of numbers
my automobile is a piece of crap
my favorite food and my birthday
my heart is going boom boom boom
my love walks right to your door
not a single damn thing was true
parame nalryo dangshin gyeoteuro
parame nalryo dangshin gyotyeuro
passed the tree to catch the bus
pick me back up when i fall down
rock band that we loved the most
saturday night i'm makin' louise
say to me that you'd do anything
so i can learn to be responsible
so i’ll come flat out and say it
so many squares where you can go
solo 4 rounds with anticipations
sometimes my life feels so empty
sorry it had to end up like this
steamrollin’ all around the room
step up i’ll mess with your face
sweetly turn the pages on always
take back that sad word good bye
tell me there’s some hope for me
that deeper peace is penetrating
that’s the way that you wanna be
that’s why i made that pop music
the best of times are on the way
the egg nog always makes me sick
the foreman has injured his hand
the greatest man that ever lived
the son is drowning in the flood
the thing that i did on that day
the unusual is the fucking usual
their tongues are making a sound
then he goes back where he wants
there is passion in my heartache
there used to be no better brand
they’re about to call the police
this happened to me twice before
this was just a very first start
through the day that i loved you
thursday night i'm makin' denise
to settle down with a good woman
we could get up and get get down
we’ll cast all our troubles away
we’ll never know just who we are
we’re gonna hit the town tonight
what kind of future will we have
when i was a baby i was so happy
when i'm feeling blue and lonely
why can’t you get me on the line
will i say that they were stupid
with a girl that i can hang with
without you little diane i'd die
you don't have to worry about me
you know i love playing with you
you know what you want me to say
you might need help i won’t know
you picked me up when i was down
you said you never heard of them
you scare me like an open window
your family hates the thought of
your friends are laughing at you
you’ll be right there next to me
'cause way down deep inside i cry
10 o'clock and i know i gotta hit
ain’t nobody gonna try and defeat
another one you say like too much
as everything i need is denied me
baby i just might take the chance
bad girls like you are a disgrace
beaten down can't even get around
buy some groceries to eat my fill
cause i need cash to pay my bills
close my eyes and drive real fast
come back and bring back my smile
come on come on come on i feel it
daddy says i gotta pay some bills
deep in the shaded glen i saw you
driving by your place every night
got me got me running out of line
hang on till the break of the day
he always had a smile on his face
how i need a hand in mine to feel
hurling amplifiers and mic stands
i ain’t got thing to prove to you
i can’t express the things i want
i don’t know where that came from
i have many fears about rejection
i like to think that i know a lot
i never know what you’re gonna do
i never listened to too much jazz
i promise that i’ll never ever do
i sulked around i didn’t know why
i threw out the love of my dreams
i would never turn my back on you
if a grain of the salt is missing
if i could the end would be happy
if you want to destroy my sweater
it's a crying shame i'm all alone
it’s so easy to roll through life
i’m pissed off cause no one cares
i’m the best that you’ve ever had
i’ve been scared for far too long
let me come to your house my dear
lets throw our hearts in the mire
make me want to oo ah oo ah oo ah
memories pile up in my small room
my fashion sense is a little wack
never before have i felt this way
occasionally i give my dog a bone
party like tomorrow is my funeral
please remember i’m only a friend
rock stars that we loved the most
said i had these two best friends
second guessing almost everything
shireul ssobwado mojaran dangshin
so get in your car and pick me up
some people can get by on nothing
sometimes i wanna’ pack it all up
stay at home and have a good time
stephen hawking can’t explain you
switched up and re wrote the book
take me with you cause i’m lonely
tell me there’s a logic out there
that is why i want to be with you
that you better not stop the show
the dozer will not clear its path
then i don’t know what i’m saying
there ain’t any words to say this
there’s so much waiting out there
they love to call you their names
they’ll be there when you wake up
this is our toast to what you did
try my best to moonwalk on a wire
what did we ever do to these guys
when i look through my binoculars
when you’re dealing with the kids
where they speak no word of truth
with the boys from 'round the way
you got the shirley applebee look
you make me wish i was a catholic
you probably hear it all the time
'cuz i think we’d make a good team
40 input how much cash do you want
80 if a$ = be my friend then print
ain’t got no one to really love me
always sing your love to me softly
as you moved the people to sobbing
back in my hotel i'm totally alone
beautiful lights shine in the west
coda double scott’s melody on lead
deleted i’ve seen this game before
down with me i’m takin’ you higher
give me strength to see me through
has filled the void behind my face
his eyes affixed to what was on tv
how do oceans connected by a straw
i asked her if she had a boyfriend
i collect all the things he leaves
i do like you you're the lucky one
i don't wanna be a old man anymore
i feel like jay this can’t be life
i feel uptight on a saturday night
i got the money and i got the fame
i know lots of people in the bronx
i might need some time to remember
i ride the train to work every day
i spoke my piece i’ll go on my way
i still need to know i’m something
i try my darnedest to be a bastard
i will turn and look the other way
i wonder how you feel about me too
i would rather see you flip me off
i'm a lot like you so please hello
i'm bailin' out i hate the race of
i'm looking out for something more
if you wanna mess around like that
is not one of the black hole songs
it when i tell you that i need you
it's gonna kill when you desert me
it’s time to move to the next life
i’m glad that i have been with you
i’m going to be more than a friend
i’m just a no class beat down fool
i’m totally caught up on your hook
i’ve been standing here for a long
kadarmoreul nunmul mani arungorine
keep fishin’ if you feel it’s true
meet you on the other side of hope
might have smoked a few in my time
my fashion sense is a little whack
no mouth to speak about their past
not knowin' where we're gonna stay
okay bitches weezer and it’s weezy
once you feel that freedom is true
one of us keeps changing every day
rockin' to the sky who's afraid to
she led me to drink the cold water
sometimes i feel just like a ghost
sorry you didn't end up in my arms
spend the night down in the gutter
the pain you felt has burdened you
the things you wrote to cut me off
there ain’t no hope for me anymore
there ain’t no one in all creation
there are blue birds in the meadow
there’s nothing more for me to say
there’s one other thing on my mind
these are the songs i keep singin’
they’re all so beautiful and clean
though i loved you i was so afraid
time to get this shit off my chest
to get with you and be your friend
waiting for little clues to appear
we gotta patch up the damage first
we have to face that it's over now
we sell ourselves for petty change
we were good as married in my mind
we’ll take all of em one at a time
what were you doing with my friend
where would be without their light
who’s down for forgetting the past
why am i so hung up on your sister
without it we'd never got this far
you can bring meaning to what i do
you know that we are gonna be okay
you make the rain clouds disappear
you're all that i wanted of a girl
you’ll know what i’m wanting to do
you’re givin’ me all that i desire
you’re gonna love the risin’ above
a super friend to make things right
ain’t got no one to kiss and hug me
all the love we made               
always rue the day that i loved you
burn the bridges down to the ground
cold and hungry cryin' on the phone
cos you are the best lawyer in town
could you ever know how much i care
deliver you a mountain size of love
do you wanna face the great unknown
doesn’t mean that much to the world
eagle feather in her feathered hair
even though my love has walked away
even though my love is a world away
everybody knows we went out full up
excuse my manners if i make a scene
from the wood in the floor she said
he didn’t want to think of this day
hit top speed i'm still movin' much
how you’ve learned to shoot so well
i ain’t got a thing to prove to you
i asked her if she had a girlfriend
i asked you if you had a good heart
i collect all the things they leave
i don’t know what the heck is goin’
i don’t wanna get with your program
i finally settled down with my girl
i had to go and make a few mistakes
i hate to be that man in your phone
i have many doubts about my motives
i hear my song playin' on the radio
i played with my friends in the mud
i see the comfortable place to rest
i wanna believe that you're the one
i wonder how you decorate your room
i'm waxin' down it's really a blast
i've got the dungeon master's guide
if you don’t leave the world behind
if you’re looking for me i’m in vip
it could be heaven it could be hell
it’s not the way you thought it was
i’m just a loser on his way to work
i’ve been told that i’m goin’ crazy
left the scholars to figure out why
maybe i should play the lead guitar
my friends are just as screwy as me
my song that flew away in the winds
my throat slit or my fingers hacked
oblivious to all the hate around us
one more dream vanished up in smoke
please honey girl won't you be cool
save the sweets for the young girls
see if we can create a horn section
so i’ll turn and look the other way
someday i’m gonna break out of here
sometimes i wanna go back to school
standing there deep in front of you
that hole you're digging in my ribs
that you better not take it from me
that’s the point i’m tryin’ to make
the bodies lie too high to see over
the world is blind though it shines
the world is blind to what it finds
then i got older and noticed a girl
there’s nothing much that we can do
they just told me to polish my lens
this place is crawling with zombies
trying to find a new place to start
turn off those stupid singing shows
until he went up and left me lonely
up to the top of the very last drop
watch me unravel i’ll soon be naked
we are so happy in everything we do
we should have died a long time ago
we’ll dance and sing the night away
we’re turning this place into a zoo
what's the harm in knowin' one more
when i’m soaked in melodies of bach
where things will never be the same
why are all american girls so rough
wilbur and jack and otis and beatty
you could keep my fingernails clean
you left your cello in the basement
you would keep my fingernails clean
you're all that i need in the world
you’ll never do the things you want
'cause no one touches me like you do
after the havoc that i’m gonna wreak
all the players in the orchestra pit
back in 1991 i wasn’t havin’ any fun
bgv lyourics and punctuation deleted
bust out the hammer time moves y’all
can’t you see that she belongs to me
cause you can’t feel any love inside
come to knock me screaming overboard
cut my heart with a martyour’s spike
don't leave me here with these tears
gina and shannon and keebie and gabe
hold on to the joy you've got inside
i am hoping for a chance to get away
i breathe love and see her every day
i could not think of anything to say
i don’t have any feeling in my heart
i don’t love you i can’t help myself
i have to earn money to pay my bills
i hope that i ain’t freakin’ you out
i made a shrine with pictures of you
i see you with your eye on the hatch
i still have the map she made for me
i swear to you i ain’t got much time
i was born to give and give and give
i was happy as a little boy could be
i went to a show last saturday night
i will ape a goombah if you’re tired
i would rather hear you curse me out
i'm trying not to stare at her chest
is it cool if we slash up this place
it’s something that you’re born into
i’ll never forgive you can’t you see
i’m givin’ you flak for your airport
i’m like a mage with the magic spell
i’m such a mystery as anyone can see
i’m the greatest man that ever lived
letting him put you down on the snow
little children walking hand in hand
monday to sunday i hit all the clubs
my friends got some new ninja swords
my head gets cold at night sometimes
never mind the past living for today
one more tear falling down your face
sharin’ chicklets from the same pack
someday i’ll have a family of my own
someday i’m going to make em believe
that girl can't ever hurt you enough
the pop stuff is somewhat successful
the redhead said you shred the cello
there was no record of dad or of mom
there’s just one thing i need to say
there’s more that i hold in my heart
there’s only so much more i can take
there’s something i’ve held way down
these are the songs that make me cry
they are one of the most hated bands
they don't make stationery like this
to break the silence and let me know
we lost track of the passin’ of time
we won't need them where we're goin'
wednesday night i'm makin' catherine
we’ll never forget the jams you made
we’re gonna rock around the clock n’
when i get the things i want to have
when i was tryin’ living without you
when the housemaids scrub the floors
when you kiss me and say you love me
why can't i be makin' love come true
why you wanna go and do me like that
with her red hair and a smiths shirt
with only just a year or two to live
you got the hots to ride on my plane
you said you loved it more than ever
you’re too crazy to settle down with
ause that’s the way that you wanna be
cause now we’re finally going to land
cos that egg nog always makes me sick
curse myself for being across the sea
didn't stop until she hit new orleans
get to see the world inside your eyes
gimme some love gimme some love sugar
groceries spillin’ up out of your bag
holding on to what he loves o so much
how the hell is she gonna get it back
i am the greatest man that ever lived
i can console you and give you a kiss
i don’t believe you wanted to know me
i don’t believe you wanted to show me
i got some tiki torches in the garage
i tried and tried to get to the truth
i wanna break down and give in to you
i want to hear it over and over again
i want you to love me like i love you
i want you to think that i don't care
i've got a number of irrational fears
it tries to find you you run and hide
it's time i got back to the good life
i’m a do the things that i want to do
i’m fine and dandy with the me inside
i’m letting all of these feelings out
letting him fill you up with his wine
letting him flatter you with his line
nobody wanted my action dead or alive
one more time i have crossed the line
rosetta stone could not translate you
sent by someone who calls up and says
somebody said all the world’s a stage
sometimes i would listen to the radio
sometimes it seems you're not with me
sometimes you fall and skin your knee
sweetness came on down from above you
teacher says i gotta learn some facts
that i drank some of grandaddy’s beer
that they underestimated me all along
the driver swears he learned his math
the world has turned and left me here
then i wonder who’s haunting who most
there's rules about old goats like me
there’s just one thing i have to know
they’d throw rotten eggs into traffic
they’re bringing bottles of the goose
though we’d fight i loved you so much
we comb our hair like we’re gangsters
we went down to the bank of the river
we're goin' where the wind is blowin'
well i won’t be a number on your list
we’re gonna go caroling in ocean park
what does he do to you that's so nice
what’s the point of trying to pretend
with ten thousand people just like me
with your button down shirt tie smack
won’t you allow me to give you a ride
you chilled and now you must bust out
you know how dumb the house rules are
you spoke for the world in your songs
you think that i'm some kind of freak
you told me that you’d always love me
you withheld the physical love i need
you’ll be reborn as a beautiful child
you’re letting him take what he wants
you’ve got to question your situation
about anybody else on earth themselves
all the times we told each little lies
before i knew it we had our own babies
changing into street clothes in a tent
chicks are trying to grease the wheels
could you be the one to really love me
could you ever know that out somewhere
from the jock with the old school meat
hates him with all of her heart       
hippie songs could be heard in our pad
i can't be someone that you wish i was
i can’t work a job like any other slob
i don’t appreciate this excess company
i don’t like how you’re living my life
i have always hurt the one that i love
i ran around and talked to the animals
i soon forget all about responsibility
i told you stories about my chickadees
i walk around in a wide awake daydream
if i'm a dog then you're a bitch pause
if we wanna get the ship back to earth
is it just the fact that i am the king
it’s getting hard to breathe over here
it’s time for me to show what i’ve got
i’m going to try to improve my manners
i’m watchin’ my life go down the drain
i’ve got a shrine with pictures of you
leave behind everything i used to know
little do they know i’m making my move
made me feel so bad living without you
memories make me want to go back there
ne jokuman gongan sogeh juokman sahigo
nothing compared to what you can bring
oo wee oo i look just like buddy holly
so i can make it in the widener stacks
sometimes i strain and i lose my sight
sometimes i want to strangle your neck
soon i’ll be playin’ in your underwear
tell me that you think we’re all alone
tellin’ em stories of savage cannibals
the choo choo train left right on time
the sun always shines when you’re near
the walls feel like they’re closing in
the wave is comin' i ain't got no fear
there's nothin on the tv reality shows
these are the songs that make me happy
they put me on the plane and they said
they were all just a little bit wicked
they will need for me to be full grown
they'd strut around and do their thing
they’ve given up what they tried to do
thinkin’ you’ll end up a penniless hag
tuning into the stations on the stereo
we started to smile it was our destiny
we take em out one at a time  chorus 3
we’ll take the form of a freight train
we’re as happy as a couple hare krisas
when i walk to the park with my doggie
where i come from isn’t all that great
why do all american girls act so tough
you used to be impressed with my badge
you wanted attention and did i mention
you would be safe and i would be proud
your heart is beating you wind up dead
you’ll turn the heads of a million men
an east coast college with some history
as my bones break and i taste the steel
break down and lose your sweet mind now
chasing her leaves me with nothing pain
cos they knocked me screaming overboard
don't forget the purpose of the mission
don’t evaporate like a beautiful mirage
everyone likes to dance to a happy song
everything i want is taken away from me
from such a distance living without you
guess what i received in the mail today
how comical this stuff that makes a man
i can’t believe this world is gonna die
i gotta have faith if i wanna see clear
i haven't much i can give you in return
i just made love with your sweet memory
i know what is right i do what is wrong
i see the girl that you are deep inside
i sing to you every day and every night
i skype my family it feels like a chore
i start to drift off with you beside me
i was overcome by a spontaneous emotion
i wish that i could explain who you are
if you want to try to speak to me again
it’s time that we laid you in the grave
i’m standin’ in line for the first time
let’s chalk it up to stockholm syndrome
loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo loo
my friends all made the whip lash sound
ne jokuman gonggan sogeh juokman sahigo
only my heart and a promise not to turn
pile into the front seat of my old ford
rockin' to the sky who's afraid to rock
somebody's cold one is givin' me chills
somebody's heine' is crowdin' my icebox
talk smack then i’m a’gonna shut you up
teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
the way that we were living in our past
then i put them up under the microscope
there to make me feel like i don’t suck
there’s no cause for these symptoms now
these are days that will define my life
they seem invincible as they surf along
when i look at it nothing comes through
when i wake at the break of the morning
when i walk to the park with my doggies
when i’m dreamin’ i know that it’s okay
why do we fight all the time like mafia
you can’t write me off as a misanthrope
you know the answers you don’t know why
'cuz you don't wanna play around no more
all i have to do is swing and i’m a hero
excuse the bitchin' i shouldn't complain
here's to all the times we're gonna have
i can’t believe this world is over there
i can’t wait no more i’ve got to move on
i don’t give a hoot about what you think
i feel happy inside when i see your face
i forgot about the things i used to like
i gotta have faith if i wanna’ see clear
i have way too much pride to go for this
i honestly don’t feel like i can make it
i spent all my time followin’ her around
i thought i could get a new pop audience
i tried describing you to all my friends
i want a girl who laughs for no one else
i wonder what clothes you wear to school
i write you in spite of years of silence
i'm just meant to be your latest tragedy
i've got the prettiest girl in the world
it’s time that we laid you in your grave
i’ll take you out to dinner at palermo’s
i’ve got the answers to the tangled knot
i’ve got the prettiest girl in the world
momma would scold us if we got too rough
no more words will critics have to speak
see how you’re living living without you
she drew me up a map with a fountain pen
sit drawing up the plans and re erect it
so make a move cuz i ain't got all night
so make a move cuz i ain’t got all night
someday i know that you will come around
that's the way we modern dukes will fend
that’s what i’ve been trying to tell you
the building's not goin' as it's planned
the sea is foamin' like a bottle of beer
the song came on the radio now people go
there isn’t anybody else exactly like me
they left me here with no one by my side
this is the dawning of a brave new world
though i’m trained to stay in this state
totally wasted and trying to find a date
was more important than the plans i made
we all evaporate like a beautiful mirage
we know the feelin that we share is true
when i'm away she never leaves the house
wouldn't it be a cruel joke if it's true
you preferred to go to a volleyball game
you told me you would be here by my side
you're such a little evil child ya ya ya
all the girls in the corner gettin’ loose
any friend of diane’s is a friend of mine
anyone can see we ain’t two peas in a pod
at first i was sure i didn’t exist to her
benatar were there the day jo lennon died
come down on the street and dance with me
deep in your heart you know that i’m more
don’t you worry for too long cuz you know
exploit it in my art and my relationships
he let them use the pool all day for free
i got my satin jacket and i'm really cool
i have a wife and a child waiting at home
i need help and you're way across the sea
i never thought that this was meant to be
i thought that i would never use the bong
i told you that you couldn’t be more lame
i turned away as you fell onto the ground
i wanna’ pack and slap and slap your face
i won't be comin' back round here no more
i'm waxin' down so that i'll go real fast
if choosing one means losing all the rest
i’ll eat my candy with the pork and beans
kiss me while we both are still invisible
look at me girl and get up off your shelf
my slayer tshirt fit the scene just right
open the door and let your love come down
our minds are free to fly where they will
see what kind of serendipity today brings
show you that you can do better than this
somebody's giving me a whole lot of money
sometimes i wonder if you’re just a ghost
still your bijon lingers on and on and on
the moon was shining on the lake at night
the one i love is still waiting out there
then you dropped my flowers on the ground
this is the way that a man loves his lady
throw out the keys and the wheel locks up
til you came round with your pretty style
turn your eyes away from me when i’m near
water me girl and let me ease the drought
we should give all our love to each other
what will we say when our kids come to us
what's a matter babe are you feelin' sick
when i fall down you put me back together
when you run out of fuel i'm still afloat
wuh nuhnuhnuhnuhnuhnuhnuhnuh that’s right
you can choose to go your way if you want
you come like a dog when i ring your bell
you have more rules than the fuckin' army
you told me stories about your chickadees
you took me home to meet your mom and dad
back to the strat with the lightning strap
every chance that i get i am placing a bet
i am dreaming of a chance to make it right
i asked you to go to the green day concert
i didn’t think it would turn out like this
i don't care what they say about us anyway
i don't know if i wanna lead on this woman
i hope you don't mind if i play the stereo
i know it's hard cause you got a lot to do
i must live for peace till the day is done
i swear that i ain’t like those other boys
i thought that i would never even miss her
i threw out the love of my dreams boy in c
i told you that you had put on some weight
i wanna spread the news that you're untrue
i wish i could get my head out of the sand
i won't be comin' back 'round here no more
if you know the notes sing from your heart
in the dressing room at the pizza hut park
it had a baby on it and he was naked on it
it’s everybody everywhere forever and ever
it’s like you fell straight out of the sky
let the jokers learn a lesson that is true
look me in the eye when i'm talking to you
maybe you could break my heart next summer
my buddies and their honies all come along
my headphones are still on the seat of her
open your heart and let the good stuff out
ratts that run round and round in the maze
she won’t be coming back round here no way
so i went to your room and read your diary
the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
there's something you should probably know
they didn't like bb guns or stupid archery
they didn’t like bb guns or stupid archery
they walk on by me like i ain’t even there
this bummed out feeling that she’s over me
till you came round with your pretty style
to look at you when i look you in the face
turn your back to make me look like a fool
well i guess you had better learn to frown
we’d call out names and then start a fight
what used to mean a little now means a lot
when i saw you groovin’ on the dance floor
when you express what you feel deep inside
work it out at the gym to fit my underwear
would be perfect for a destination wedding
you got a fix of what it is i want to hear
you'll be trapped forever under their shoe
cheering my spirits with laughter and mirth
diane would help me pass out all the flyers
doin’ things my own way and never giving up
here it’s clear that i’m not getting better
how long before we turn to live another day
i care about you from the inside to the out
i deal out my buisness if i can get a trick
i gotta live on an island to find the juice
i hope nobody bothers me cause i’m so tired
i just need to admit i want sugar in my tea
i knew this girl back in junior high school
i read the program by the light of my phone
i will love these songs until the day i die
i'm goin' surfin cuz i don't like your face
i've got your letter and you've got my song
it might take a while to get with the style
it’s only the weak that fall for your spell
i’d been hanging around in a cloud of shame
i’ll party by myself i’m such a special guy
let me tell you about a band i loved when i
life is so cruel without you here beside me
my heart shrivels when the light is shining
oakley makes the shades to transform a tool
one look in the mirror and i’m tickled pink
that’s all i got to say to you at this time
then she put her cheek on my shoulder and i
these nucleotides are paired up in a strand
trombone player to do gtr bends in verses –
watching grunge leg drop new jack through a
we thought the future was lookin’ so bright
when everything is wrong i come talk to you
when he takes your hand and kisses it twice
where they play riffs with a hard rock beat
you ask me if i’m ready to get down to work
you know that this isn’t the end so hang on
you told me you would move heaven and earth
your beauty has faded you’re a broken shell
'n i don't even know how i got off the track
a mosh pit started and then the crowd parted
city streets at night can be so intimidating
don't let them get you down cause if they do
g to cio cio san fall in love all over again
give me a chance if you could force yourself
grooving to the way i roll with my rock band
how long before we turn to let love fly away
i ain’t gonna wear the clothes that you like
i don’t know how my life turned out this way
i should drag you down 'cause you're no good
i talked for hours to your wallet photograph
i want a girl who will laugh for no one else
i'd be good for you and you'd be good for me
i'm gonna mold ya into something that i like
i'm just a regular white guy who's afraid to
it’s a hip hop world and we’re the furniture
it’s hard to celebrate so far away from home
i’d like to think there’s a chance of repair
letting him do all of the things he wants to
sometimes it’s hard to know what i should do
sometimes my best wasn’t good enough for you
the knee stocking flavor is a favorite treat
the sea is rollin' like a thousand pound keg
there you are in front of me with your smile
this storm is gonna pass like they always do
though i can’t satisfy all the needs she has
warming my heart on this cold winter’s night
was lookin’ at her and she was lookin’ at me
we can self publish a book of our philosophy
we watched titanic and it didn't make us sad
when i’m dreamin’ i know that it’s all right
words of deep concern from my little brother
you broke down and told me you loved me true
you heard me on the radio about one year ago
you said you never heard of them how cool is
your slayer t shirt fit the scene just right
a bluebird is flying and looking for his mate
another big bang and you're down on the floor
at 10 i shaved my head and tried to be a monk
cause i’m drifting further from you every day
cause i’m strong enough to show you i’m a man
every day you come to the office looking fine
everyone clapped when i asked her to marry me
gotta stop mixin’ alcohol and pharmaceuticals
he acts like he knows that he has a big thing
he doesn’t want to die any more than you or i
i am totally head over heels in love with you
i can't remember where longtime sunshine goes
i fall to pieces when you softly call my name
i know it's hard cause you got a lot to prove
i know that you don’t care i want you to know
i see you’re unsure of the place that you are
i shouldn’t waste em on these friends of mine
i swear to you that i will never let you down
i want you to know it’s not just us right now
i will be a slave to you until the bitter end
i won't be ashamed of the things we once made
if you need love then i’ll be here to sex you
i’ve lived a good life i’ve got no complaints
mister springsteen said he had a hungry heart
my fingertips and toes are frozen to the bone
not somethin' real so i'd rather keep wackin'
on the sun in the sky as it sets out of sight
one night at the disco i wanted to dance slow
over the wall you’re spinning round and round
repeat scott’s melody without him for 1 round
so turn off the tv cuz that’s what others see
that we’re waging on each other for ever more
the first thing i did when i got up the nerve
there is no other one who can take your place
thinking bout the things that could have been
wasn't she your favorite bitch in the academy
we made a promise and our will won’t fade out
we’ll be together from now until the very end
you gimme my pills and sing this strange song
you knock me on my knees and i can't stand up
you know it makes me sad to see her like that
you make things alright when i’m feelin’ blue
you try to play cool like you just don’t care
you went out with somebody named kevin greene
all the memories make me want to go back there
all the times we looked into each other’s eyes
down on santa monica where tricks are for kids
everyone wants to be cooler than everyone else
he and the astronauts are now a laughing stock
i cant help my boogies they get out of control
i don’t have the patience to keep it on the up
i wanna see somethin' i never seen before so i
in the evening when she goes out walking alone
it’s like walking through a graveyard at night
leave this lonely life behind forever and ever
maybe if i work with him i can perfect the art
my headphones are still on the seat of her car
nobody else out there could ever make me happy
the way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile
they say i need some rogaine to put in my hair
till they bring the curtain down on this stage
to the others who love to call you their names
when i'm away she puts her makeup on the shelf
you got a look that makes me think you're cool
bring back the nights when i held you beside me
comin’ through the frequencies and the airwaves
could you please come in my office for a second
fall to my knees and give birth the painful way
give me an hour before you throw me in the cold
i got so many people that i got to look out for
i know that you’re thinkin’ i’m tryin’ to score
i need some yummy vittles for my famishing eyes
i’m gonna be a star and people will crane necks
movies are as bad as eating chocolate ice cream
pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage
put me in a special school cuz i am such a fool
somebody's giving me a whole lot of money to do
that's just a stupid dream that i won't realize
the girls will show me their love high up above
the rest of the summer was the best we ever had
things are better out here than they might seem
we will sing the melodies that you did long ago
we’d light the things on fire for cheap thrills
when i think about the other people i could see
all along the undertow is strengthening its hold
all i could think about was being with you alone
all the trash that is sweepin’ you under the rug
cause i’m waiting for the starlight in your eyes
he does what he can and he never tells her maybe
here i sit waiting beside the tree all by myself
i can’t tell you how the words have made me feel
i don’t wanna hurt nobody a bee has got to sting
i got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
i gotta go turn in my rock star card and get fat
i have lost all hope for being normal once again
i hope you know that i don’t mean you disrespect
i stepped to the floor with her best friend jill
i thought the older women would like me if i did
i wanna see you pretty ladies on the dance floor
i'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time
it’s a hundred years before you change your mind
i’ve got to have a lot of pretty girls around me
the world don’t care if you are or are not there
they’re holding back the hope that keeps me sane
were playing perfectly fine i just didn’t get it
we’ll be together from now until the end of time
when i see your pretty face i almost want to cry
you know we’re gonna’ turn back time to the 80’s
'cuz i'm a burning a candle you're a gentle month
as bears come to get me cause they like my behind
as they search the night for someone to hold onto
bring back those nights when i held you beside me
deep down i know you're just a friend of a friend
glorious plans we make are forcing things in line
he’s struggling to live he doesn’t have much time
i could never touch you i think it would be wrong
i hate what you do when your poison seeps through
i remember the days when i was stronger than wall
i thought it’d be good for you and me to check in
i will be here waiting girl until the end of time
i will learn by studying the lessons in my dreams
i'm afraid to close my eyes when i'm going to bed
i'm just a regular white guy who's afraid to rock
letting him do all of the things that he wants to
maybe i got too excited and maybe you freaked out
navy business suit clinging tightly to your spine
please don't believe her she says that for anyone
so i don't always end up warming up the same shit
the best of your days will all vanish in the haze
to get a glimpse of me and see if i am having sex
try as anybody might they couldn’t move me at all
we had just one night it lingers on and on and on
we started talkin’ and then it was so clear to me
we're all we've got and we don't want to be alone
when i think i've found a good old fashioned girl
why i am so unlike the singers in the other bands
'cause you might play so monastic that you blow it
'n i'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
all the players in the were playing perfectly fine
givin’ up and growin’ old and hopin’ there’s a god
hangin' 'round with chicks like you i do like you 
i don’t need a single book to teach me how to read
i thought tonight was a night like any other night
i will find what is true in my soul i won’t let go
if you're wondering if i want you to i want you to
if you’re wondering if i want you to i want you to
it’s all just a gift that i’m going to give to you
punchin’ in and punchin’ out and suckin’ up to bob
send weezer polyphonic ringtone to your cell phone
so many reasons why i have to go want to stay here
so you send me your love from all around the world
we didn’t know what we were doing half of the time
when i am holdin’ you and you are holdin’ on to me
when i think about the way your little heart beats
you are the angel and i am the one that is praying
you got the look in your eye and you smack my butt
you're wanting to know all about me and my hobbies
you've got to learn to reach out there and grab it
'cuz i can't even look in your eyes without shakin'
excuse me while i rummage through my targus backbac
i don’t know what kind of drugs he or she was doing
i gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
i'm afraid you'll crack the phone down over my head
i’ve been watching you girl from the back of my car
maybe that’s the chemistry that takes us to the top
still i don’t believe that i can keep it all inside
there’s a spider in the drain and he’s feeling pain
wasn't she a she your favorite bitch in the academy
we’ll be together from now until we’re up in heaven
what's in the back of that little kid mind of yours
you are crying out that you need to speak your mind
you got that look in your eye and you smack my butt
i didn’t do that cuz i didn’t want the cow to be sad
i know that i can be the meanest person in the world
i pray the killer doesn’t take the life of the party
i want to bask in the delight that is your womanhood
messing with the journalists and tellin’ stupid lies
my boss was trippin’ and actin’ like a freaking jerk
please don’t shoot me down i’m an endangered species
there is another love that i would rather be obeying
what could you possibly see in little ol' 3 chord me
when i was younger i used to go and tip cows for fun
with a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
after practice sometimes we would break into mad fits
g to teco music on the bus while we earned our checks
glorious plans we make are forcing all things in line
going up in smoke rings like a moth within your flame
i got together with my bros in some rehearsal studios
i was next to you and you were right there next to me
it breaks my heart to see you hangin’ from your shelf
i’m waiting for a chance to show you how i long to be
maybe i just have to call you up and scream and shout
no one likes too much attention from a desperate fool
quiet riot got me started with the banging of my head
the party hearty aesthetic of wuan and dondo don juan
there may come a day when we have nothing left to say
timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart
when criminals are victims looking back into our past
who’s down for saying fuck it all’ and having a blast
you put on your headphones and you step into the zone
all of my friends tell me that i ought to play it cool
everytime i pin down what i think i want it slips away
i don't want my mom to know that i've been a dirty boy
i got a confession that i will make if you will listen
i just want to find the thrill that i felt once before
i was dreaming of happy times that we both could share
i'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon
if i said something else to you then i would be a fake
if there are any problems with the deposit or contract
it’s just the thought of you in love with someone else
i’d hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool
i’m gonna play some heavy metal riffs and you will die
maybe i’ll find the answers in one of these nightclubs
playing hacky sack back when audioslave was still rage
take no prisoners here in this knock down drag out war
than give me fake smiles and all that nervous laughter
think of consequence then you move when it’s your turn
watching all the freaky dutch kids vomit then have sex
we are the angels and we are the ones that are praying
you twitch in your seat cause you wanna hit the street
you wish you could quit cause you’re really sick of it
your mom cooked meat loaf even though i don’t eat meat
000 will need to be sent to the property owner tomorrow
all the times you came to me and told me that you cared
eddie rabbit sang about how much he loved a rainy night
i would like to give a demonstration of what it is i do
i’m gonna be a rock star and you are gonna bear with me
i’m just pointing out all of the facts i double checked
somehow all these faces look like exactly like the rest
watching grunge leg drop new jack through a press table
we’ll stick together as we’re trippin’ down the freeway
when the conversation stops and we're facing our defeat
when the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
with the one thing that brings light to all my darkness
you just listened you laughed enchanted by my intellect
come up to me and say hello to my heart how stupid is it
it’s not my destiny to be the one that you will lay with
i’ll know the words to say to draw you in so close to me
put your hands up in the air like you don’t care no more
street signs and traffic lights ever confusing the issue
the thing i finally found with these other girls in town
you are 18 year old girl who live in small city of japan
you cause such a fuss cause there’s no one you can trust
you’d hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool
a mustache is fuming and yelling at a lackey in a meeting
i admired the glowing the stars and tried to play a tune'
i never thought it'd come to this now i can never go home
keep on going 'til i get someplace where i can truly rest
the song came on the radio now people go this is the song
all of the times you came to me and told me that you cared
grover washington was happy on the day he topped the chart
i'm on fire to be with you tonight and make your body come
i’ll sack the quarterback and jack the brother of the ball
then the conversation stopped and i looked down at my feet
each one of you is a top graduate of the star corps academy
stab the corpses and lick the knives like we’re evil forces
then i heard the chords that broke the chains i had upon me
then the conversation stopped and i looked down at the ring
when you’re out with your friends in your new mercedes benz
as if i could live on words and dreams and a million screams
figure out who can play the gtr solo on whichever instrument
i can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed
i can't remember the other girl's name she was the good girl
don’t you worry for too long cuz you know these are the songs
gordon lightfoot sang a song about a boat that sank in a lake
tonight i know that i am gonna be seeing the moons of jupiter
we signed a deal to get the dough to make a record of our own
we were so sure of ourselves and sure of our way through life
in order to move forward as humans we need to start sanding up
they don't make stationery like this where i'm from so fragile
you show up late for school cause you think you’re really cool
let me tell you about a band i loved when i was a west side kid
through smeared mascara i looked into your eyes and saw a light
tonight i’m leavin’ all my worries and my problems in the house
your folks were next to you and you were right there next to me
i was driving this morning and sat in traffic on the way to work
i’ve reached a higher place that no one else can make a claim in
they had a feeling that something was up of the look in our eyes
give me an hour before you pick me up and throw me 'cross the sea
i guess i've been into irreconcilable dichotomies for a while now
she thinks that we can take all the measurements down at the site
it takes two to make a thing go right when we hold on to the night
they’d blow up mailboxes or with a baseball bat go for direct hits
i don’t want to have to approve each stinking dollar that we borrow
i never know when i’ll be called away to buy some food at the store
don’t you dare touch that dial cause i got style for miles and miles
bang a knock on the door another big bang and you're down on the floor
that everything’s gonna’ be fine and we can quit the wild life we know
this way is a waterslide away from me that takes you further every day
when i start to feel the feeling comin’ over me i really want a chance
cooped up for a year with the two best looking babes i've seen all year
me and my girl ain’t speak in weeks and i can’t remember the reason why
it takes two to make a thing go right if the fresh prince starts a fight
so i sniff and i lick your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
the time for me to leave this place don’t feel like it’s gonna ever come
then we played our first rock show and watched our fanbase start to grow
i wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea
late in the night times we’d drive around with hairspray and sharp knives
this way is a waterslide away from me that takes you further every day hey
some perspiration is forming and rolling down the thigh of someone luscious
i wish i could get my head out of the sand 'cuz i think we'd make a good team
i’ve got bills on top of bills and i don’t know where i’m gettin’ my money from
at the break of the mornin’ a cat name stevens found a faith he could believe in
that way there's no way i will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces
i'm very disappointed not to be hearing any women out there singing maria's parts
at the break of the mornin’ a cat name stevens found a faith that he could believe in
i need help and you're way across the sea
i could never touch you i think it would be wrong
